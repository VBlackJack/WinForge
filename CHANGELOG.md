# WinForge Framework - Changelog

Note: the framework version source of truth is `Config/version.json`. Launchers and GUI read this value dynamically.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- The Applications update scan button now uses clearer "Scan for Updates" wording.
- Required prerequisite apps now remain manageable in the Applications grid with an explicit prerequisite badge and uninstall warning.
- Rebranded public project identifiers, GUI assets, launchers, runtime data directory, and documentation from Win11Forge to WinForge.
- Added startup migration from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Win11Forge` to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\WinForge`, with graceful fallback to legacy data when migration is blocked.
- Scheduled deployments now use WinForge task names while continuing to discover and manage legacy Win11Forge scheduled tasks.
- Persisted logs and operation result messages now resolve WinForge-owned localized strings in English and file logs are written as explicit UTF-8 without BOM.

### Fixed
- Dashboard update scans now run directly through the update coordinator, so the Scan for Updates button cannot get stuck waiting on a disposed Applications view handler.
- Chocolatey now self-updates through `choco upgrade chocolatey` instead of trying the WinGet bootstrap package during update operations.
- Applications selection now routes checked `Update Available` apps through the update workflow, installs only not-installed apps, and skips apps that are already current.
- Refresh Updates now forces a fresh update scan and update caches are invalidated after install, update, or uninstall operations.
- Update scans now suppress trailing-zero version false positives such as `2.7.3` versus `2.7.3.0`.
- Refresh Updates now stays executable when installed/updateable apps exist even if display counters are stale.
- Process output capture now uses UTF-8 consistently and deployment logs omit raw localized package-manager output from the main log stream.

## [2026062201] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- Existing profiles can now be updated directly from the Applications grid while preserving inherited applications from parent profiles.
- Added a shared icon dropdown button style and applied it to the Apps column visibility menu.
- Added a public architecture overview and refreshed user-facing profile editing documentation.

### Changed
- Unified dark semantic colors through the ThemeForge runtime palette and fixed brush opacity preservation for tinted row backgrounds.
- Tokenized GUI font sizes and corner radii through named application resources.
- Normalized icon button styles and App Catalog toolbar button metrics.
- DataGrid selection now renders as a clean full-row accent-tinted highlight instead of a per-cell focus rectangle.
- Root launchers now prefer fresh release GUI binaries over stale Debug artifacts.

### Fixed
- Localized the ThemeForge 2.1.0 Magellan theme name in the theme picker.
- Fixed application update detection when the WinGet PowerShell module is unavailable.
- Refreshed the Applications "Has Updates" filter after scans so update rows appear immediately.

### Removed
- Removed unused Dracula theme dictionaries and dead button styles.
- Removed internal historical audit documentation from the public documentation set.

### Profile editing and public documentation cleanup — June 2026

#### Added
- **Existing profiles can now be updated from the Applications grid.** After applying a profile, users can check or uncheck apps and save that selection back to the active profile. Inherited applications remain owned by their parent profile and are restored with a warning when a child profile is updated.
- **Added a public architecture overview.** `Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` now summarizes the current runtime layout, GUI architecture, profile model, theming pipeline, API surface, and validation commands.

#### Changed
- **Updated user-facing documentation.** `README.md`, `Docs/USER_GUIDE.md`, `Docs/README.md`, and `Docs/GUI_VM_VISUAL_CHECKLIST.md` now document profile editing and avoid local machine paths.
- **Removed internal historical docs from the public documentation set.** Old closed-work archives and detailed internal ADR/audit notes were removed in favor of the concise public architecture page.

### Application catalog utilities refresh — June 2026

#### Added
- **Added six utility/runtime catalog entries.** `WindowsAppSDK21`, `BleachBit`,
  `FluentCleaner`, `MicrosoftPCManager`, `Textify`, and `Capture2Text` are now
  present in `Apps/Database/applications.json`. `WizTree` was already present,
  so it was not duplicated.
- **Declared FluentCleaner's Windows App SDK runtime dependency.**
  FluentCleaner installs from the GitHub portable ZIP and now depends on the
  Windows App SDK 2.1 runtime entry, with Microsoft's signed 2.1.3 runtime
  installer as the direct fallback.

#### Changed
- **Direct ZIP portable deployment now allows executable archive contents,
  expands detection-path environment variables, and flattens single-root
  archives.** This keeps DirectUrl ZIP apps such as FluentCleaner installable
  and deployed to the same folder their file detection checks.

#### Fixed
- **DirectUrl installs now load shell-folder path helpers before creating temp
  download folders.** `InstallationMethods.psm1` imports
  `DirectoryConstants.psm1` so `Install-ViaDirectDownload` can reliably resolve
  the temp directory.
- **Dependency satisfaction handles single required dependencies under
  StrictMode.** `Test-DependenciesSatisfied` now normalizes dependency output to
  an array before counting missing prerequisites.

### Direct-download publisher gate activation — June 2026

#### Security
- **Authenticode publisher gate now enforced for the AIMP direct-download.**
  `Sources.ExpectedPublisher = "IP Izmaylov Artem Andreevich"` is now populated
  for AIMP, bringing verified coverage to 18/20 signed direct-downloads.
  `ABDownloadManager` is unsigned and `FileZilla` remains CDN-protected, so both
  remain intentionally dormant.

#### Changed
- **Enabled Authenticode publisher enforcement for 18 direct-download apps.**
  Added empirically verified `Sources.ExpectedPublisher` values for signed
  direct-download installers so the existing installer signature gate now
  fails closed on publisher mismatch for those apps. `ABDownloadManager` and
  `FileZilla` remain dormant pending signing or download-source verification.
- **Removed broken sponsored2 direct-download fallback for FileZilla.** CDN hotlink-protected 403 wrapper bundles offers; FileZilla now installs via Chocolatey only.
- **AIMP direct-download URL switched to the version-stable official endpoint.**
  The direct URL now uses `https://aimp.ru/?do=download.file&id=3` to avoid
  per-release URL drift.
- **Added maintainer publisher probes.** `Tools\Get-DirectDownloadPublishers.ps1`
  reports `{ AppId, Url, Status, Bytes, SignerSubject }` from downloaded
  installers, and `Tools\Set-DirectDownloadExpectedPublishers.ps1` applies the
  approved publisher mappings with a BOM-safe dry-run-first workflow.

#### Fixed
- **Refreshed the stale Signal Desktop direct-download URL.** Updated the
  fallback from `7.0.0` to `x64-8.12.0`, restoring the broken direct-download
  fallback while keeping the existing Authenticode publisher gate enforced.

### Button visual hierarchy restored — May 2026 follow-up

After visual inspection of the `v2026051001` release built from the unified
flat-text state, the lack of visual hierarchy on every action button proved
unworkable in practice — hero CTAs, dialog confirm buttons, and toolbar
actions all rendered as identical plain text labels. Reversed §2.6 of
the historical design notes for the full rationale. Those internal notes are
no longer part of the public documentation set.

#### Changed
- **Restored 70 `Appearance` attributes** across 20 view files to their
  pre-PR #94 values — `Primary` for constructive primary actions
  (Confirm/Save/OK/Apply/Install/Add/Start/Restart/etc.), `Secondary` for
  outlined actions (Cancel/Close/Browse/Test/Filter/Save Profile/etc.),
  `Danger` for App Catalog row Delete. Hero CTAs (Start Deployment, Fix
  Prerequisites) regain their accent fill. Inline `Background` / `Foreground`
  / `Padding` / `Height` overrides previously stripped by PR #94 are **not**
  restored — the implicit `ui:Button` `Style.Triggers` in App.xaml drive the
  theme-adaptive look from `ThemeAdaptiveAccentBrush` / `BadgeTextBrush`.

#### Kept (unchanged from PR #94)
- Forked WPF-UI 4.3 `ui:Button` `ControlTemplate` with the
  `ContentBorder.Opacity=0.45` disabled-state workaround.
- `Secondary` and `Transparent` hover/pressed re-targeted to `SurfaceBrush`
  for WCAG AA contrast (~5.6:1–6:1).
- Apps view fixes (Column Visibility menu, `_selectedCount`
  `NotifyCanExecuteChangedFor`, DataGrid cell vertical centering).
- ThemeService `PaletteBrushResourceMap` extensions (~22 button/checkbox state
  keys) and `Palette*Color` entries.
- Keyed styles `HeroPrimaryButton` / `PrimaryButton` / `SecondaryButton` /
  `DestructiveSolidButton` / etc. remain defined in App.xaml as a fallback
  API; views still drive look through `Appearance="..."` directly.

### UI flat-text consolidation + WPF-UI 4.3 disabled-state fix — May 2026

Visual unification pass and several orthogonal Apps-view defect fixes uncovered
along the way.

#### Changed
- **App-wide flat button presentation.** Every `Appearance="Primary|Secondary|`
  `Danger"` and every `Style="{StaticResource HeroPrimaryButton|`
  `WarningPrimaryButton|SecondaryButton|DestructiveSolidButton}"` instance is
  now `Appearance="Transparent"`. ~60 buttons across 15 files: `Views/AppsView`,
  `Views/AppCatalogView`, `Views/DashboardView`, `Views/PrerequisitesView`,
  `Views/DeploymentView`, `Views/SettingsView`, `Views/LogsView`,
  `Views/SaveProfileDialog`, `Views/ApplicationPickerDialog`,
  `Views/Dialogs/ApplicationEditorDialog`, `Controls/ConfirmDialog`,
  `Controls/EmptyStateControl`, `Controls/ErrorDialog`,
  `Controls/KeyboardShortcutsPanel`, `Controls/LoadingOverlay`,
  `Controls/OnboardingDialog`, plus four `UserControls/*SourceEditor` and
  `UserControls/DetectionEditor`.
- **Hover contrast WCAG AA.** `Secondary` and `Transparent`
  `MouseOverBackground` / `PressedBackground` re-targeted from `HighlightBrush`
  (~`#4A4E66`, ~2.25:1 vs purple text — fails AA) to `SurfaceBrush`
  (`#1B1C25`, ~5.6:1–6:1 against the configured foregrounds — clears AA).

#### Fixed
- **Column Visibility menu silently broken (Apps view).** The `ui:Flyout` placed
  inside `<ui:DropDownButton.Flyout>` was silently ignored at runtime
  (`Flyout` is typed `ContextMenu`). Replacement attempt with
  `ui:Button + ContextMenu + Click handler` failed because the menu's
  `PlacementTarget="{Binding ElementName=...}"` evaluates inside the
  `ContextMenu` NameScope and could not resolve. Fix: adopt the
  `ui:DropDownButton` + flyout `ContextMenu` pattern already used in
  `AppCatalogView`. Removed the `ColumnVisibilityButton_Click` handler and the
  dead `_isColumnVisibilityPopupOpen` `[ObservableProperty]`.
- **WPF-UI 4.3 disabled state painted Light Fluent on dark Dracula.** The
  upstream `controls:Button` `ControlTemplate.Triggers` writes
  `ContentBorder.Background = {DynamicResource ButtonBackgroundDisabled}`,
  and that `DynamicResource` lookup does not honor any user-scope override at
  any level we tested (`StackPanel.Resources`, `ui:Button.Resources`,
  `UserControl.Resources`, or `Application.Current.Resources` direct entry —
  all probed and verified inert). Fix: fork the upstream
  `DefaultUiButtonStyle` `ControlTemplate` verbatim into our App.xaml implicit
  `ui:Button` style. Single deviation: the `IsEnabled=False` trigger now sets
  `ContentBorder.Opacity=0.45` instead of overriding the three brushes. The
  fork preserves `Icon` DP support, `RecognizesAccessKey`, `PressedForeground`,
  the `InsetBorder`, and every upstream `Appearance` trigger.
- **`UninstallSelectedCommand` `CanExecute` not refreshed when selection
  changes.** `_selectedCount` in `ViewModels/AppsViewModel.cs` only had
  `[NotifyCanExecuteChangedFor(nameof(InstallSelectedCommand))]`. Added the
  matching attribute for `UninstallSelectedCommand`. Without it, Uninstall
  Selected stayed in the visual disabled state after the user picked an item,
  even though `CanUninstallSelected` would have evaluated `true`.
- **DataGrid app-name column visibly top-biased.** Outer `StackPanel`
  `Orientation="Vertical"` of the Application Name `CellTemplate` defaulted to
  `VerticalAlignment="Stretch"`, so the cell-level `VerticalContentAlignment=`
  `"Center"` had no effect on the rendered text position. Set
  `VerticalAlignment="Center"` on that panel and on the Selection
  `CheckBox` cell template. Title + description now sit at row center within
  ~3 px.

#### ThemeService bridge
- Extended `PaletteBrushResourceMap` with rest/hover/pressed/disabled state
  keys for `Button*` and `CheckBox*` (~22 new mappings) so all WPF-UI control
  states pull Dracula brushes.
- Extended `PaletteColorResourceMap` with `PaletteRedColor` /
  `PaletteGreenColor` / `PaletteOrangeColor` / `PaletteLightBlueColor` Color
  overrides — preserved for forward compatibility even though no instance
  currently uses `Appearance="Danger|Success|Caution|Info"`.

### Dead code + i18n audit pass — May 2026

Two-axis cleanup pass closing 18 dead-code and localization findings across 7 self-contained commits. No behavior change at runtime; build, 566 GUI tests, Pester suite, PSScriptAnalyzer, FR diacritics lint, and version-consistency check all green.

#### Removed
- **PowerShell manifest cleanup (DC-013)** — `Core/Core.psd1` no longer declares `Test-AdminRights` or `Get-FrameworkVersion` in `FunctionsToExport` (these functions never existed in `Core.psm1`).
- **Resx keys cleanup (DC-002 to DC-012)** — 10 unused EN+FR resx pairs deleted: `AppEditor_Category`, `Apps_SelectWithUpdates`, `Dashboard_Updates_Available`, `Deploy_InheritedFrom`, `Deploy_Installing`, `Help_Shortcut_Actions`, `Help_Shortcut_Navigation`, `Recovery_NetworkTimeout`, `SourceEditor_TestPlaceholder`, `Toast_UninstallComplete`. Designer.cs trimmed where applicable. Guard test `DeadResourceCleanup_RemovesUnusedKeys2026May` added on `AccessibilityHardeningTests`.
- **IAccessibilityService scaffolding (DC-001 / DC-008)** — `IAccessibilityService`, `AccessibilityService`, `AnnouncementPriority`, DI registration, `MainWindow` field/initialize call, plus correlated resx keys `Accessibility_Progress`, `Accessibility_ProgressWithItem`, `Accessibility_ProgressComplete`, `Accessibility_DeploymentStarted`. Live-region screen-reader behavior is preserved via the existing XAML automation properties on `ScreenReaderLiveRegion` (PR #61/#62 baseline) and the 5 `LiveRegionAttributesTests` guards.

#### Refactored
- **Centralized GUI timeouts (ZH-002, ZH-003, ZH-004)** — three duplicated/literal timeout values now live in `GUI/Win11Forge.GUI/Configuration/TimeoutDefaults.cs` (`HttpClient` 15 s, `PackageOperation` 30 s, `CacheWarmingShutdown` 2 s). PowerShell install timeouts continue to live in `Config/timeouts-settings.json`.
- **Centralized GitHub project links (ZH-001)** — `GUI/Win11Forge.GUI/Configuration/ProjectLinks.cs` now provides `Repository`, `Issues`, `NewIssue`. `ErrorDialog` and `SettingsViewModel` route through this single source; the `ErrorDialog` issue-report fallback path is now consistent with the primary URL (previously dropped the `/new` suffix).

#### Documented
- **ReDoS regex timeout (ZH-005)** — `JsonApplicationDetectionService.RegexTimeout` (500 ms) is annotated as intentionally non-configurable to prevent attacker-controlled config from disabling the protection.

Resx parity after this pass: 943/943.

### Post-audit debt closure - May 2026

Closed the remaining non-audit and technical debt backlog through PR #82-#91. The baseline is now `2026050901`, with `Config/version.json` as the display-version source of truth.

- **Localization SSoT** (PR #82): supported GUI locales now flow through `SupportedLocales`, with runtime resolver, Settings language picker, and resx parity tests aligned.
- **Logs localization sweep** (PR #83): user-facing Logs status strings, filters, export filter, and delete confirmations now come from EN/FR resources. Resource parity moved to 957/957.
- **Calendar versioning** (PR #84): release tooling, GUI project properties, manifests, schema, and version consistency checks now use `YYYYMMDDxx` display versions with assembly versions derived as `1.0.MMDD.sequence`.
- **WinSight smoke harness** (PR #85): added opt-in `Tools/Invoke-WinsightSmoke.ps1` for local desktop smoke checks through the sibling WinSight MCP server. The legacy xUnit UIA harness remains opt-in.
- **Application editor save fidelity** (PR #86): application saves preserve entry order, UTF-8 BOM state, unchanged metadata, and no-op saves avoid rewriting `applications.json`.
- **Update Pause/Resume clarity** (PR #87): `IsUpdating` now hides batch Pause/Resume controls during selected updates instead of exposing inert actions.
- **WF-005 strict profile safety** (PR #88): switching away from an applied profile now detects manual selection drift and reuses Replace / Merge / Cancel safety semantics.
- **ExportSelection flake hardening** (PR #89): import/export tests now use isolated temporary directories, retry-safe cleanup, explicit success/error assertions, and no shared dialog service state.
- **Application bridge cleanup** (PR #90): removed unused `IApplicationBridge.InstallApplicationsAsync` and its batch progress/result types; batch install remains owned by `IAppInstallationCoordinator`.
- **Theme cleanup + coverage** (PR #91): `ThemeNames.DraculaResourcePathPrefix` is the single Dracula resource path prefix, and migration/converter fallback coverage was added.

### MVVM refactor closure

The architectural refactor of the GUI ViewModels (audit findings I1, I3, I4) is complete. All four batch operation coordinators (`AppScanCoordinator`, `AppInstallationCoordinator`, `AppUpdateCoordinator`, `AppUninstallCoordinator`) are extracted under `Services/Coordinators/`, sharing the internal `AppOperationRunner` helper for parallelism, cancellation, and progress reporting. The `AppsViewModel` god class (3 002 lines, 31 RelayCommands) is now a 531-line orchestrator with twelve cluster-scoped partial classes. WPF lifetime coupling, file dialog handling, and code-behind business logic have been moved behind dedicated services (`IApplicationLifetimeService`, `IFileDialogService`, `IApplicationEditorDialogService`, `IPauseGate`).

See `Docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the current public architecture overview.

### UX audit closures - May 2026

Completed the P0/P1 remediation sweep from the May 2026 UX review, then closed the remaining P2/P3 UX backlog through PR #81.

#### Accessibility
- **Closed A11Y-001** (PR #67/#68): High Contrast resources are preserved when switching Dracula themes.
- **Closed A11Y-002** (PR #69/#70): Reduced Motion now gates code-driven animations; stale storyboard-only controls were removed.
- **Closed A11Y-003** (PR #71/#72): High-visibility focus visuals cascade through implicit WPF and WPF-UI button styles.
- **Closed A11Y-004/A11Y-005/A11Y-006** (PR #61/#62): Live region announcements stay in the automation tree; DraculaPro text contrast and Light-theme orange contrast now meet WCAG AA.

#### Naming and visual hierarchy
- **Closed UX-001 and DC-002** (PR #63/#64): The admin catalog surface is consistently named App Catalog, including `AppCatalogView*`, `AppCatalog_*` resource keys, and navigation IDs.
- **Closed DC-001/DC-004/DC-011** (PR #65/#66): Page typography tokens, shared source badge styling, and subtler DataGrid gridlines now apply consistently across the GUI.
- **Closed DC-005/DC-006/DC-007/DC-008** (PR #79): AppsView now follows the icon/title/subtitle header pattern, profile/filter cards reflow without forced horizontal card scroll, Settings tabs have a reinforced selected indicator, and navigation separates workflow pages from configuration pages while preserving `ViewIndex` tags.
- **Closed DC-012/DC-013/DC-014** (PR #80): Post-smoke polish hides unavailable AppCatalog actions, removes the duplicate AppsView install CTA, and gives shared TabItems a theme-aware selected template.
- **Closed DC-009/DC-010** (PR #81): Settings card headers no longer repeat tab-strip icons, and audited card borders now use the shared `CardPadding` token across views.

#### Workflow safety
- **Closed WF-003/WF-005/WF-006** (PR #73/#74): Single-app uninstall now confirms destructive action; profile changes protect manual selections with Replace/Merge/Cancel; profile tier badges are derived from JSON inheritance instead of hardcoded tiers.
- **Closed WF-007** (PR #75/#76): Update Selected now mirrors Install progress UX with current app, progress percentage, ETA, cancellation, and final summary.
- **Confirmed WF-008 closure** (PR #55/#56): App Catalog empty states are gated on loading and load-error state, with distinct empty-database and empty-filter copy.
- **Closed WF-011/WF-012/WF-013/WF-014** (PR #81): Selection helpers respect active filters, import selection/favorites uses Replace/Merge/Cancel previews, Settings auto-save no longer spams info toasts, and cancellation paths now confirm with progress context.

### Added

- **Test coverage** — `AccessibilityHardeningTests` adds three static-analysis guards: `RequiredA11yLocKeys_ArePresentInXaml` (theory across the 6 a11y-touched XAML files), `HighContrastMode_TextOnAccentBrushes_AreRemapped` (asserts the 3 `SwapIfExists` entries in `App.xaml.cs`), and `HighContrastTheme_ImplicitlyStylesWpfUiButton` (asserts the implicit `ui:Button` style based on `HighContrastButtonStyle` in `HighContrastTheme.xaml`). Total test count: 527 passed (`dotnet test -c Release GUI\Win11Forge.slnx --filter "FullyQualifiedName!~UIA"`).
- **Test coverage** — `AccessibilityHardeningTests` adds four static visual-hierarchy guards for P-15: AppsView header pattern, AppsView filter/profile reflow without `MinWidth="920"`, implicit `ReinforcedTabItemStyle`, and workflow/config navigation clustering. Total test count: 531 passed (`dotnet test -c Release GUI\Win11Forge.slnx --filter "FullyQualifiedName!~UIA"`).
- **Test coverage** — `AccessibilityHardeningTests` adds three post-smoke guards for DC-012/DC-013/DC-014: AppCatalog unavailable action visibility, AppsView install CTA deduplication, and theme-aware TabItem template states. Total test count: 534 passed (`dotnet test -c Release GUI\Win11Forge.slnx --filter "FullyQualifiedName!~UIA"`).
- **Test coverage** — PR #81 adds guards for filtered Apps selection helpers, import Replace/Merge/Cancel behavior, cancel confirmations, Settings no-toast auto-save, AppEditor source-specific a11y keys, AppCatalog HC contrast, dead resource cleanup, Settings icon de-duplication, and cross-view `CardPadding` token usage. Total test count: 554 passed (`dotnet test -c Release GUI\Win11Forge.slnx --filter "FullyQualifiedName!~UIA"`).

### Changed

- **Applications workflow** — `SelectAll`, `SelectNotInstalled`, `SelectFavorites`, and `SelectWithUpdates` now operate on the active filtered application list; `SelectNone` remains global to clear hidden selections deliberately. Closes WF-011 (PR #81).

### Fixed
- **Workflow safety (WF-012)** — Import Selection and Import Favorites now show Replace / Merge / Cancel previews when current state is non-empty, summarize matched/missing/final counts, and leave state untouched on cancel. Closes WF-012 (PR #81).
- **Workflow feedback (WF-013)** — Settings auto-save updates continue to set inline status, but no longer fire repetitive info toasts during every keystroke/toggle change. Closes WF-013 (PR #81).
- **Workflow safety (WF-014)** — Apps batch cancellation and Monitoring/Deployment cancellation now prompt before requesting cooperative cancellation, including completed/total context. Closes WF-014 (PR #81).
- **Visual hierarchy (DC-009)** — Settings keeps tab icons but removes redundant repeated icons from section headers inside cards. Closes DC-009 (PR #81).
- **Visual hierarchy (DC-010)** — Audited card borders across Apps, AppCatalog, Dashboard, Deployment, Logs, Prerequisites, and Settings now use `{StaticResource CardPadding}` instead of literal `16`/`20` card padding. Closes DC-010 (PR #81).
- **Accessibility follow-up** — ApplicationEditorDialog source action buttons now use source-specific automation names for Winget, Chocolatey, and Microsoft Store search/apply actions. Resolves the AppEditor P3 a11y follow-up (PR #81).
- **Accessibility follow-up** — High Contrast AppCatalog header contrast is guarded by WCAG AA tests and HC brush mappings for mapped surface brushes. Resolves A11Y-011 candidate (PR #81).
- **Resource cleanup** — Removed dead `AppCatalog_DeleteMultiple*` EN/FR resource keys and hardcoded English fallbacks in `LogsViewModel.ClearOldLogsAsync`. Resolves TODO cleanup follow-ups (PR #81).
- **Visual hierarchy (DC-012)** — AppCatalog now hides Undo/Redo and row actions when unavailable instead of rendering large disabled blocks. Closes DC-012 (PR #80).
- **Information architecture (DC-013)** — AppsView keeps `Install Selected` only in the selection action bar, removing the duplicate Profile-card CTA. Closes DC-013 (PR #80).
- **Visual hierarchy (DC-014)** — Shared WPF `TabItem` styling now uses a theme-aware template with explicit hover, focus, selected, and disabled states. Closes DC-014 (PR #80).
- **Visual hierarchy (DC-005)** — AppsView now mirrors the app-wide page header structure with an `Apps24` icon, `PageTitleTextStyle`, `PageSubtitleTextStyle`, and new localized `Apps_Subtitle` resource. EN/FR resource parity is 920/920. Closes DC-005 (PR #79).
- **Visual hierarchy (DC-006)** — AppsView profile and filter cards no longer force internal horizontal scrolling through `MinWidth="920"`; both surfaces now reflow in a two-row responsive layout. Closes DC-006 (PR #79).
- **Visual hierarchy (DC-007)** — Settings and shared WPF `TabItem` surfaces use `ReinforcedTabItemStyle` with a stronger selected underline and selected-state tint. Closes the DC-007 implementation scope; stronger post-smoke tab treatment is tracked separately as DC-014. Closes DC-007 (PR #79).
- **Information architecture (DC-008)** — Main navigation now separates workflow and configuration clusters with `NavigationViewItemSeparator`, moving App Catalog next to Settings while keeping Settings `Tag="4"` and App Catalog `Tag="5"` stable. Closes DC-008 (PR #79).
- **Accessibility (A11Y-007)** — Sweep `AutomationProperties.Name` on AppsView toolbar buttons (LogViewer Copy/Close, Summary Close, Save Profile, Reset Columns) and ApplicationEditorDialog source actions (Search + Apply Selection × 3 sources). Screen readers now announce explicit names instead of relying on inferred Content text. Closes A11Y-007 from the May 2026 UX review (PR #78).
- **Accessibility (A11Y-008)** — High-contrast mode now remaps `TextOnAccentFillColor*` brushes (Primary/Secondary/Disabled) to high-contrast foreground variants in `App.ApplyHighContrastMode`, and selectively applies `HighContrastButtonStyle` to `ui:Button` only (WPF-UI). Resolves the 1.07:1 white-on-cyan hover regression on accent-painted buttons in HC mode. Plain WPF `Button` controls remain untouched to preserve custom-styled buttons. Closes A11Y-008 (PR #78).
- **Accessibility (A11Y-009)** — Settings toggle switches (Reduce Motion, High Contrast) now expose their descriptive subtitle via `AutomationProperties.HelpText`, in addition to the existing `Name`. Closes A11Y-009 (PR #78).
- **Accessibility (A11Y-010)** — Explicit `AutomationProperties.Name` added to templated/dialog buttons that previously relied on inferred announcement: Prerequisites Check (StackPanel-wrapped Button with ProgressRing), ConfirmDialog Cancel/Confirm, ErrorDialog Help/Retry/OK. Closes A11Y-010 (PR #78).
- Hardened the Windows runner CI baseline after enabling strict Pester gating.
- Replaced a fragile File detection fixture path with a stable system executable present on Windows Server runners.
- Made Store app detection tolerate app definitions without optional `Sources.Store` metadata.
- Kept plugin load sandbox validation compatible with Constrained Language Mode by performing AST validation before constrained module execution.
- Added GUI test hang diagnostics and a 20-minute timeout to the coverage step.
- Converted GUI coverage enforcement to a baseline floor with an explicit 80% target warning while the MVVM coverage backlog is completed.
- Reactivated the `SettingsViewModel` history-clear test after replacing its modal `MessageBox` dependency with `IDialogService`.
- Closed audit finding I4: code-behind business logic in `ApplicationsView` and `AppsView` migrated to ViewModels via dialog services and pure XAML context menu bindings.
- Advanced I1 phase 2 with `AppUpdateCoordinator` extraction (PR #44): parallel scan-for-updates and sequential update-apply are modeled as separate coordinator workflows, the two PR7-tagged provisional semaphores in `AppsViewModel.Update.cs` were absorbed, and a test guard now prevents accidental re-parallelization of `UpdateAsync`.
- Completed I1 phase 2 with `AppUninstallCoordinator` extraction (PR #45): all four coordinators (Scan, Installation, Update, Uninstall) now live under `Services/Coordinators/`. PR #45 also completed the residual `MessageBox.Show` migration to `IDialogService.ShowConfirmAsync` across ViewModels (`SettingsViewModel`, `LogsViewModel`, and Uninstall), satisfying the DoD §8.1 dialog invariant.

## [3.7.2] - 2026-02-12

### New Features
- **Added**: REST API async server mode with background job management (`Start-ApiServerAsync`)

- **Fixed**: Added `Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Security` to `SecureStorage.psm1` for PowerShell 5.1 compatibility (DPAPI types not auto-loaded)

### Zero Hardcoding Audit Remediation

Complete audit remediation addressing 225+ violations across conformity, code quality, and architecture.

## [3.6.7] - 2026-02-05

### Bug Fixes

#### Office Installation Detection
- **Fixed**: `Wait-ForOfficeInstallation` stuck in infinite loop

  - But `OfficeClickToRun.exe` is a permanent Windows service, not just an installation process
  - Fix: Always check if Office is installed first (registry/files) on each iteration
  - Only monitor installation-specific processes (`setup`, `OfficeC2RClient`), not the permanent service

#### GUI Timeout
- **Fixed**: Increased installation timeout from 30 to 47.5 minutes
  - Must exceed Office Click-to-Run 45 minute timeout to prevent premature cancellation

#### DirectDownload (v3.6.4)
- **Fixed**: URL query parameter handling for filenames
  - URLs like `?installer=Battle.net-Setup.exe` now correctly extract the filename
  - Added proper parsing of query parameters instead of using raw URL path

#### GUI Stability (v3.6.3)
- **Fixed**: Binary content filter in log viewer to prevent GUI freeze
  - Filters out DOS executable headers (MZ) and high ratio of non-printable characters
